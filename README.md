# Climbing Judge

Climbing Judge is the app that helps judge climbing competitions. 

For now it covers only one of three climbing disciplines - LEAD (Lead, Bouldering, Speed). 

## LEAD

Lead competition consists of three rounds: eliminations, semi-finals and finals.

In eliminations every competitor climbs on each of two eliminations routes. 
The result of this round is calculated by combining scores from both routes.

Twenty six best from eliminations start in semi-finals.
Semi-Finals are optional in case there is a small number of competitors.

Eight best from semi-finals start in finals.
